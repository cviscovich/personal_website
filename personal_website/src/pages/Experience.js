                    Over the course of my undergraduate career at NC State, I have had the incredible
                     opportunity to intern with a couple of great companies and amazing teams. I have
                     gained invaluable experience and canâ€™t wait to start working full-time. My focus
                     for the future is learning how to use my passion for CS to help with issues of
                     social and economic justice. I believe that we have many amazing technologies
                     available to us and we have only scratched the surface of what can be done!
